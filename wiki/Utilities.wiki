#summary biopy utilities.

Version 0.1.2 contains three utilities which may be of interest to non programmers.

== BEAST utilities ==

* starbeast_demog_log.py

  A specialized utility for `*`BEAST users. The population size numbers as reported in the BEAST log can be misleading, since they may refer to diffrent populations at diffrent stages of the MCMC chain. This utility generates a new trace file, viewable in tracer, tracing population size(s) for each population encountered during the run.

* summary_tree.py

  Create a summary tree from posterior trees. BEAST tree annotator utility first picks up a topology, then independently assigns heights to each internal node. Sometimes this can be suboptimal - in the worst case the tree contains branched of negative length.  summary_tree takes a more global approach and looks for a tree which minimizes the overall distance to the whole set of posterior trees, using a tree distance measure.  

== Generic utilities ==

* sample_ranked_tree.py

  Uniformly sample a ranked labeled tree from the space of all ranked labeled trees with a fixed *unranked* topology.
