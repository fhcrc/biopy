Biopy documentation
===================

Biopy is a python based collection of bioinformatic related code.

Biopy contains code for exploring and developing phylogenetic
ideas. biopy is useful for generating simulated data and performing
off-line analysis.

Some parts are specific to BEAST and \*BEAST in particular.

biopy is **not** a high-duty, high-performance library, but a small
part is implemented in C++ to ease some pain.

This code requires Python 2.7 and the following packages:
`numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org//>`_, `scipy <www.scipy.org//>`_, lxml,
matplotlib and biopython.
