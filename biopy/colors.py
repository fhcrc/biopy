## 3) The set of 26 colors for the Colour Alphabet Project suggested by Paul
## Green-Armytage in the above-cited work "A Colour Alphabet and the Limits of
## Colour Coding." This color set is designed for use with white background. The
## RGB triplets of this set are:

PGAcolors = [[240,163,255],[0,117,220],[153,63,0],[76,0,92],[25,25,25],[0,92,49],
             [43,206,72],[255,204,153],[128,128,128],[148,255,181],[143,124,0],
             [157,204,0],[194,0,136],[0,51,128],[255,164,5],[255,168,187],[66,102,0],
             [255,0,16],[94,241,242],[0,153,143],[224,255,102],
             [116,10,255],[153,0,0],[255,255,128],[255,255,0],[255,80,5]]
