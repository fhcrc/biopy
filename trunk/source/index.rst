Biopy documentation
===================

Biopy is a python based collection of bioinformatic related code.

Biopy contains code for exploring and developing phylogenetic
ideas. biopy is useful for generating simulated data and performing
off-line analysis.

Some parts are specific to BEAST and \*BEAST in particular.

biopy is **not** a high-duty, high-performance library, but a small
part is implemented in C++ to ease some pain.

This code should work with Python 2.5 and up (python 2.7 is
recomended). For full functionality the following packages are
required: `numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org//>`_, `scipy
<www.scipy.org//>`_, lxml, matplotlib and biopython.
